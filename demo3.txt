The message:

On branch master  
nothing to commit, working tree clean


means that Git did not find any changes in your working directory or staging area to commit.

Here's what might have happened:

✅ You already committed all your changes.

❌ You didn’t make any changes to the files after the last commit.

❌ You didn’t add new files or stage any changes using git add.

To commit new changes, follow these steps:

Make changes to a file or create a new file in your Git repo directory.

Check status to see what's changed:

git status


Stage the changes:

git add .


or to stage specific files:

git add filename


Commit the staged changes:

git commit -m "your commit message"
